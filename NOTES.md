#Notes

##Style

The swift package manager requires everything under source to be at the same level (if we want it to compile to one executable/target)

Also, look at the template to build your files

Use a functional style as much as possible

##Todo

- Come up with a name
- Is there a better name for "Automata"?
- Need to add a way to display custom messages for actions
- We should set up a server application and a separate client application
- Decide which combat system to use
- Work out how Positions vs. Locations work
- Implement AI for NPCs?
